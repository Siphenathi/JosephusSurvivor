In this kata you have to correctly return who is the "survivor", ie: the last element of a Josephus permutation.

Basically you have to assume that n people are put into a circle and that they are eliminated in steps of k elements, like this:

josephus_survivor(7,3) => means 7 people in a circle;
one every 3 is eliminated until one remains
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] - initial sequence
[1,2,4,5,6,7] => 3 is counted out
[1,2,4,5,7] => 6 is counted out
[1,4,5,7] => 2 is counted out
[1,4,5] => 7 is counted out
[1,4] => 5 is counted out
[4] => 1 counted out, 4 is the last element - the survivor!
